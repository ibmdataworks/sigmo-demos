#DSX: Machine Learning
##Introduction

 In this lab we will explore how a data scientist utilizes DSX and IBM
 Bluemix cloud services to easily analyze data using machine learning
 techniques and to visualize the outcomes using DSX, R, and Brunel. For
 the lab, we have chosen two algorithms to demonstrate supervised and
 unsupervised machine learning in DSX. Decision tree-based
 classification is one of the domains that allowed scientists to have
 direct insights into the reasoning behind classification choices.
 Association rules algorithms support market basket analysis.

 The lab shows how to use these machine learning algorithms for
 uncovering the data insights in sales data.

##Lab Components: DSX 

1.  **Source Data Repository**: **Object Storage Service**
> NOTE: This usually is the data hosted in a secure enterprise
> environment that could be securely retrieved through a network tunnel
> using the BlueMix Secure gateway. Since getting access to a data
> hosted in an enterprise infrastructure can be a compliance and privacy
> issue for this lab, we will be using sample datasets hosted in the IBM
> Object Storage that would be used as a source data set.

2.  **Exploring sales data** (for this lab, the data from IBM sample DB “GOSALES” was used):

    a.  **Using Decision Tree**: **DSX Notebooks**, **Brunel**, **R**

##Before You Begin

1.  Download Lab-DSX-ML.zip archive from the github.com location below and extract the data file (transactions.csv) to your laptop:

    > <https://github.com/ibmdataworks/sigmo-demos/tree/master/data-scientist/machine-learning>/archive
    
    Here is the content of the downloaded archive:
    
    -   Folder “data” contains the sample data “transactions.csv”
    
    -   Folder “lab” contains the following files:
    
        -   machine-learning-with-DSX-lab.ipynb – the notebook for the machine learning lab using decision trees;
        
        -   ml-lab-installation.ipynb – the notebook for installing software packages for the machine learning lab (decision trees) ;
        
        -   RStudio-apriori-demo.R – R code for the machine learning lab using association rules;
        
        -   RStudio-apriori-demo-installation.R – R code for installing software packages for the machine learning lab (association rules)

2.  Login to your IBM DSX account at:  <http://datascience.ibm.com/>
> NOTE: If you don’t have a DSX account then get started by registering
> at <https://datasciencex.typeform.com/to/hWECJ3>
3.  A quick outline of the procedures:

    a.  Decision tree lab (based on the DSX notebooks):

        i.  Provision an Object Storage service and load a file with
            sales data (transactions.csv) for the analysis

        ii. Provision an Apache Spark service to run notebooks on

        iii. Load the sample notebooks with the
            lab (machine-learning-with-DSX-lab.ipynb) and the
            installation of the software
            packages (ml-lab-installation.ipynb) needed for the lab;

        iv. Run the code in the notebook with the installation sequence

        v.  Run the code in the notebook with the lab

    b.  Association rules lab (based on RStudio):

        i.  Start RStudio

        ii. Load the data file into RStudio (transactions.csv
            into ~/data)

        iii. Load the R-code with the lab (RStudio-apriori-demo.R) and
            the installation R-code for the software
            packages (RStudio-apriori-demo-installation.R) needed for
            the lab

        iv. Run the R-code with the installation sequence

        v.  Run the R-code with the lab

> NOTE: If the same environment is sequentially used by different users,
> then the installation procedure needs to be done once per environment
> and the user only needs to go through executing the code with the lab
> without need to spend time on the installation procedures – there is
> no need to reinstall the labs for the same environment.


> NOTE: In the instructions the sequence “Menu &gt; Submenu &gt; Final
> Item” would represent the sequence of users’ actions where they choose
> first “Menu” from the menu bar, then the “Submenu” item in the opened
> submenu list, and finally “Final Item” in the yet another opened menu
> list.

8.  Select and add the files previously downloaded (transactions.csv) to this Container.
> NOTE: Your data files are now moved to the Object Storage into the
> Bluemix.

###Initializing Apache Spark: Apache Spark Service

Use the Apache Spark Service that is created for your account. You can
alternatively create a new Apache Spark Service by following these
instructions (if you are already in the UI managing Bluemix account,
please start from the step 3):

1.  In DSX, go to user profile settings ![](media/image4.png)

2.  Go to manage Bluemix account ![](media/image5.png)

3.  From the Bluemix dashboard catalog menu search for “Apache Spark”

4.  Click on the Apache Spark Service Icon ![](media/image6.png)

5.  Choose the default pre-filled values in the fields (optionally rename the “Service name:” to DS\_DSX\_ML\_Spark), select the needed  “Pricing Plan” and click “Create” at the bottom of the page.

6.  Ensure that your service is up and running – the page that you are transferred after creating the service shows the status of the service (this is highlighted with the red rectangle) ![](media/image7.jpeg)

7.  Connect your Apache Spark service to your Object Storage service:

    a.  Click on “NOTEBOOKS” button (it is highlighted in the green rectangle on the previous snapshot)

    b.  Click on Object Storage tab (it is highlighted with the red rectangle): ![](media/image8.jpeg)

    c.  Click on “Add Object Storage”: ![](media/image9.jpeg)

###Importing Notebooks for Machine Learning Lab

1.  From DSX, select DSX data science mode (the button to click on is highlighted with the red rectangle): ![](media/image11.png)

2.  From the DSX home page in Data Science mode, click on “Start” to  create a new notebook: ![](media/image12.jpeg)

3.  In the next screen named “Create Notebook”, switch to “From File” tab, name the notebook “ML Lab Installation”, and choose the notebook file on your disk from the archive: ml-lab-installation.ipynb; alternatively you can switch to “From  URL” tab and use the following “Notebook URL”:
> https://github.com/ibmdataworks/sigmo-demos/blob/master/data-scientist/machine-learning/labs/ml-lab-installation.ipynb

4.  Choose the default pre-filled values in the fields (Project: None, Spark Service: the service that you provisioned for this lab)

5.  Choose to Trust this Notebook to run with your Privileges and click on Create Notebook

6.  When DSX loads the notebook, save the current state by clicking on File &gt; Save and Checkpoint from the menu

7.  Return back to DSX home page

8.  Load the second notebook “Machine Learning with DSX: Lab” (from the file machine-learning-with-DSX-lab.ipynb, or from URL https://github.com/ibmdataworks/sigmo-demos/blob/master/data-scientist/machine-learning/labs/machine-learning-with-DSX-lab.ipynb ) by following the same steps 1-7 as above

###Switch to the Provisioned Source Data Repository in DSX Lab Notebook

This step allows to avoid overloading the default Object Storage service
by switching to the provisioned Object Storage service.

1.  From the loaded notebook “Machine Learning with DSX Lab” click on Data Sources: ![](media/image13.jpeg)

2.  The expanded Data Sources would show transact.csv under “Manage files” section

3.  Identify the cell with the implementation of getObjectStorageFileWithCredentials and replace the code to use your provisioned Object Storage service:

    a.  Place your cursor to the cell with the default getObjectStorageFileWithCredentials implementation
    b.  Create an empty code cell just above the code cell with the default getObjectStorageFileWithCredentials by clicking on the following menu items: “Insert” &gt; “Insert Cell Above” and place your cursor into the new cell

    ![](media/image14.jpeg)

    c.  Clicking on “Insert to code” on Transactions.csv will show the options to insert the code: choose “insert base DataFrame” : ![](media/image15.jpeg)

    d.  Here is a similar code that will be inserted into your new cell: ![](media/image16.jpeg)

    e.  Replace the existing implementation of getObjectStorageFileWithCredentials (starts with “&lt;- function” and finishes with the end of block “}”) with the generated code in the new cell for getObjectStorageFileWithCredentials\_&lt;unique sequence&gt;; Here is the example of the highlighted code that needs to be replaced:
     ![](media/image17.jpeg)

     Take the new code (highlighted with the green rectangle) and place instead of the old code (highlighted with the red rectangle):

     ![](media/image18.jpeg)

    f.  Remove the cell with the newly generated code after replacing the default implementation of getObjectStorageFileWithCredentials

    g.  Check point: after the modifications, the section code should still define a data frame variable df which is used in the notebook; the modifications should be done only for replacing  getObjectStorageFileWithCredentials with the newly generated code for the new Object Storage service
